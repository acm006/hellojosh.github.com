					<p>Built for <strong>LIVESTRONG Foundation</strong></p>
					<p>500+ page site redesign for LIVESTRONG Foundation. I was the lead developer on the project. Kentico CMS was used along with SQL Server 2008 to help contain the data. Custom controls were created to help the client distribute content through out all of the pages easier. A custom feed was created so that the flash piece on the homepage could be dynamic. The front-end has valid XHTML and CSS and uses jQuery for a few different UI parts. Cufon was used as text replacement so that we could achieve custom font.</p>

					<h2>AMD Collateral Generator</h2>

					<p>Built for <strong>AMD</strong></p>
					<p>This was a microsite built for AMD that is used to create wallpapers and digital signatures. I was the lead developer on the project and worked directly with the lead designer to try and "streamline" the site. We ended up making it a full-AJAX site where all of the pages and data are added without refreshing the browser. It definitely speeds the experience up.</p>

					<p>Website redesign for Unicast.com that I was the lead developer on. The site runs off of Kentico C.U.T. CMS tool which was built with C#. It is using SQL Server 2005 for data storage. I used sIFR for font replacement rather than using  bunch of different images. The site follows web standards very closely by using clean HTML and object-oriented CSS. The site was built with unobtrusive Javascript using the jQuery framework.</p>

It features an AJAX search functionality that integrates with Wordpress' existing search by using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/">JSON API plugin</a>.</p>
